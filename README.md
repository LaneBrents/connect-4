# Connect Four
Connect-Four is a two-player game in which you try to build a row of four chips that go either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while keeping your opponent from doing the same.

## How to play
* Player-one clicks on the board where they want their first chip
* Player-two clicks on the board where they want their first chip
* Alternate taking turns putting chips on the board until someone gets 4 chips in a row.
* First player to get 4 in a row wins!
